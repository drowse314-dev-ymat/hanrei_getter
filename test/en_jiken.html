<br />
Article 367 of the Civil Code<br />

(3) If the claim mentioned above has become due earlier than the pledgee¡Çs claim, the pledgee may have the third-party debtor deposit the amount payable. In this case, the pledge shall exist upon the money thus deposited.<br />
(4) Where the subject matter of the claim is not money, the pledgee shall have the pledge upon the thing received as payment.<br />
<br />
Article 132 of the Bankruptcy Act<br />

<td Valign='top'><pre>Reasons</pre></td>
<td Valign='top'>Concerning the reasons for appeal with permission argued by the appeal counsels SUZUKI Takashi and YOSHIDA Yusaku<br />
Where a pledge is established upon a claim, it is appropriate to construe that the pledgor may not petition, based on the claim, for bankruptcy of the debtor of the claim unless there are special circumstances such as the pledgee having given consent to do so. It is construed that in principle, the pledgor may not collect the claim under the pledge, and the pledgee has an exclusive right to collect it (See Article 367 of the Civil Code). If the debtor of the claim is declared bankrupt, it would have a significant impact on the pledgee in exercising his/her right to collect the claim, because it would restrict the pledgee from collecting the claim except through bankruptcy proceedings (See Article 16 of the Bankruptcy Act), and in the case where the debtor of the claim is a stock company, it would be a ground for its dissolution (See Article 404, item 1 of the Commercial Code), thereby preventing the pledgee from requesting payment of the amount that remains after receiving dividends through bankruptcy proceedings. The determination of the court of the second instance that goes along with this reasoning can be affirmed as justifiable. The appellant¡Çs argument cannot be accepted.<br />
<br />
Therefore, this court¡Çs decision was rendered in the form of the main text by the unanimous consent of the Justices.</td>
